# DMRT1 Gene Selection Inference

# Performed sequence alignment of the DMRT1 gene across 54 species, including the complete duplicated copy of Dmw, and constructed a phylogenetic tree using the guidance.sh pipeline.

# Two selection models branch test and branch-site model ran to detect signals of selection.

# Additionally, the free-ratio model to estimate independent Ï‰ (dN/dS) values for each branch in the phylogeny.
