# Perform the phylogeny analysis for 54 species(For the 54 species, a genome-wide phylogeny was constructed using a subset alignment extracted from the previously published article "Frog phylogeny: A time-calibrated, species-level tree based on hundreds of loci and 5,242 species.") using Phylogeny.sh script performed the phylogeny

# Verify gene duplication using blastn from the genome and raw reads database (Duplication_folder)

# Perform expression analysis using HTSeq-count and Cufflinks (Expression)
