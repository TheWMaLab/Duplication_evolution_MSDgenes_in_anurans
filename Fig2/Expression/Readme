# Expression of different tissues between male and female for 14 species using two different Methods#
Based on read counts from RNA-seq data of the same tissue in males and females, quantified using HTSeq-count ( Script.sh, Htseq_count.R ).
Based on FPKM values from RNA-seq data of the same tissue in males and females, quantified using Cufflinks ( Script.sh, Cufflinks.R ).
