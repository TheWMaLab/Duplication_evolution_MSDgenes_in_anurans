
#  Genomewide phylogeny for 12 species extracted from timetree and its spliting time

#  Genome-wide synteny
#Downloaded the genome and GFF files for 12 species from NCBI.
#Used TBtools-II to perform the one-step MCScanX analysis for pairwise genome synteny block identification.
#Merged all pairwise chromosome files into a single file.
#Combined all synteny blocks into a single file.
#Merged all pairwise GFF files into a single file.
#Replaced chromosome names (e.g., NC or CM or OW) with standardized names (e.g., Chr1...ChrN) based on the respective species as reported in NCBI.
#Assigned a unique color to each chromosome.
#Performed synteny plot

#  Synteny of chromosome 7, as the sex chromosome in Xenopus tropicalis and other 11 species.
#For genome-wide synteny construction and visualization, a similar procedure was employed.
