#Figure 3. Microsynteny of four possible candidate sex-determining genes
The synteny of four candidate sex-determining genes: 1. Dmrt1, 2. Bod1l1, 3. Foxl2, and 4. Sox3 was analyzed across 12 chromosome-level species using their respective annotation files. For species lacking annotation, BLASTn was used, and the gene location was inferred based on the highest alignment score. Flanking genes on both sides of the candidate gene were verified across 25 species. 
#For the query sequence, the longest isoform of the candidate gene available on NCBI was used
