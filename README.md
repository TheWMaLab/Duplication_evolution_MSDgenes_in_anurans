# Duplication_evolution_MSDgenes_in_anurans

This project is to address how master sex-determining genes arise and evolve across anurans, as well as whether and how often gene duplication drives rapid sex chromosome turnover across anurans. 
Here we provide all related codes to reproduce the analysis results for this paper.
